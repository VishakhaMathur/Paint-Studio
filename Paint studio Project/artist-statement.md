# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

In this interactive work of art, I have designed a painter's studio that comprises elements that an artist would require, including colors, a canvas board,  paintings on the wall for inspiration, some fruits as a basic necessity for energy, an energy bar keeps track of the energy user has consumed. The table holds tools like eraser, text button(for writing), pencils, canvas box, crayons, watercolors, colortubes , brushes of various sizes, and so on.


Interaction: Users need to pick color before doing anything. If they click text button without picking color, a pop-up appears. You need to click on the objects to make things work for examples; brushes- on the tip(black portion), color tubes, crayons- circle on them, eraser- white portion, pencils- at the tip, fruit- on oranges, changing canvas- on the box. You can also change the size of the brushes by using up(increase) and down(decrease) arrow key while drawing. 

The artwork is rewarding as it allows the user to undergo a studio environment. People would love to have fun by exploring its interactivity and gain an artistic experience. By this artwork, I wanted to build curiosity, inspire the creativity, and ecourage people to explore artistic world.
